SoundCloud FS
=============

This project is broken and no longer maintained.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/polyfloyd/soundcloud-fs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/polyfloyd/soundcloud-fs/actions)

This project implements a FUSE driver to serve audio files from SoundCloud. It
is optimized to avoid needless API requests and aid mass indexing by music
libraries, specifically MPD.

## Usage
`soundcloud-fs --help` :)

## Notice
This program is intended to be used as an interoperability layer for other
software and not as a way to circumvent restrictions of the SoundCloud
platform. When playing around with this program, I ask that you:

* Do not mass-download content, consider the artists
* Do not make excessive requests to the platform, consider the SoundCloud engineers
